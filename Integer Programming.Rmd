##Integer Programming (IP) is a type of mathematical optimization technique used to solve decision-making problems where some or all of the decision variables are restricted to be integers. It is widely used in industries such as logistics, scheduling, finance, and manufacturing, where solutions must be whole numbers.

# Load the lpSolveAPI package
library(lpSolveAPI)

# Initialize a linear programming model with 0 constraints and 7 decision variables
model <- make.lp(0, 7)

# Define the objective function (weekly wages for workers in each shift)
set.objfn(model, c(775, 800, 800, 800, 800, 775, 750))

# Specify that all decision variables are integers
set.type(model, 1:7, "integer")

lp.control(model, sense = 'min')


# Add constraints to ensure sufficient workers for each day
# Sunday

# Matrix to represent daily worker requirements

), ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)

# Assign column names for better readability
colnames(daily_worker_demand) <- c("Day", "Required_Workers")

# Convert to a tabular format for easy viewing
as.table(daily_worker_demand)

# Matrix to represent shift details, days off, and weekly wages
shift_schedule_and_wages <- matrix(c(
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
  "Sun & Mon Off", "Mon & Tue Off", "Tue & Wed Off", "Wed & Thu Off", 
  "Thu & Fri Off", "Fri & Sat Off", "Sat & Sun Off",

# Assign column names for clarity
colnames(shift_schedule_and_wages) <- c("Shift_ID", "Days_Off", "Weekly_Wage")

# Convert to a tabular format for easy viewing
as.table(shift_schedule_and_wages)


# Solve the optimization problem
solve(model)

# Get the total minimized cost (objective value)
total_cost <- get.objective(model)
cat("Total Cost: $", total_cost, "\n")

# Get the optimal number of workers assigned to each shift
workers_per_shift <- get.variables(model)
cat("Number of workers assigned to each shift:\n")
print(workers_per_shift)

# Get the number of workers available on each day based on the solution
daily_worker_coverage <- get.constraints(model)
cat("Number of workers available each day:\n")
print(daily_worker_coverage)

##Conclusion:

##Minimized Cost: The total weekly cost is minimized at $25,675, considering shift-specific wages and additional weekend pay.

##Worker Allocation: The optimal number of workers assigned to each shift ensures that no constraints are violated.

##Daily Labor Needs: The number of workers available each day satisfies or exceeds the required demand:

##No shortages occur, as every day's coverage meets or exceeds the specified minimum.
